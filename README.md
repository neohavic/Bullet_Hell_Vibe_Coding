# Bullet\_Hell\_Vibe\_Coding



Seeing how far vibe coding can go, especially for a more niche gaming

category as Bullet Hell/Danmaku.  

Goals are twofold: Can vibe coding, and AI specifically, build something

from scratch that mimics the likes of early Touhou? And two, can Python via

PyGame handle something like that with a minimum 60 FPS.



GOALS:

&nbsp;   - 500+ bullets at a time @ 60FPS

&nbsp;   - Complex, Danmaku bullet patterns

&nbsp;   - Boss rush only, minimum 3 bosses

&nbsp;   - Full music soundtrack

&nbsp;   - Full suite of sound effects



IDEAS:

&nbsp;   - At least two ships, traditional faster but weaker shots and slower but

&nbsp;     stronger shots, or maybe only one with switchable firing modes

&nbsp;   - Some kind of scoring system that rewards risk; buzzing maybe, even though

&nbsp;     I personally hate it? Possibly the only way if it's boss-rush only...

&nbsp;     time rewards are obvious. Maybe a sword mechanic a la Radiant:

&nbsp;         Sword parry -> powerup attack -> faster boss kill -> higher score

&nbsp;   - ??? (I'm sure there will be more)
