BULLET HELL VIBE CODING TEST

-Ausin Everman w/ MS Copilot on Win11
Started: 08/05/25

Seeing how far vibe coding can go, especially for a more niche gaming category as Bullet Hell/Danmaku.
Goals are twofold: Can vibe coding, and AI specifically, build something from scratch that mimics the likes
of early Touhou? And two, can Python via PyGame handle something like that with a minimum 60 FPS.

GOALS: 
    -500+ bullets, minimum
    -Complex, Danmaku bullet patterns
    -Boss rush only, minimum 3 bosses
    -Full music sound track
    -Full suite of sound effects

IDEAS:
    -At least two ships, traditional faster but weaker shots and slower but stronger shots, or maybe only one
    with switchable firing modes
    -Some kind of scoring system that rewards risk; buzzing maybe, even though I personally hate it? Possibly
    the only way if its boss-rush only... time rewards are obvious. Maybe a sword mechanic a la Radiant:
        Sword parry -> powerup attack -> faster boss kill -> higher score
    -??? (I'm sure there will be more)
          
TO-DO
    -Refactor code into def's
    -Tighten up main game loop (see above)
    -GRAPHICS!
    -SOUND!
    -Score system
    -Player attacks
    -Player death
